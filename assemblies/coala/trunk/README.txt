This assembly was originally created by the maven "genapp" plugin using
the template "ehf-assembly-template".

This template creates an assembly that closely resembles the standard 
ehf reference assembly that is used by development and integrates most 
of the available ehf modules. 
 
If you are interested in a leaner example assembly have a look at the
template "ehf-assembly-light-template" that includes only the base modules.

You may safely remove this README file from this newly created assembly.

Please note that this assembly supports the "IPF inside eHF" concept.
